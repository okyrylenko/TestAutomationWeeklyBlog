                        Hello everybody, my name is Oleksiy, and I am automation engineer with 6 years of experience in this field. Overall, I have been in Software Quality Assurance field for almost 10 years as of early 2021. I started my career as a manual tester and moved toward automation about 5 years ago. I’ve been working with Java and C#/.Net technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As in any field, especially in technology a person is constantly has to learn and upgrade the existing skills. I like to spend a couple hours a day on learning new technology. My day usually start at 7 am and spend 2 hours on learning. My work starts at 9 am and that is when I completely focus on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I recently applied for a couple positions and they all required “advances” knowledge for data processing and manipulation. Even though I have Associate of Science degree in programming, I feel like the data required is more advanced than what I already know. The problem is the AS degree mostly teach how to write the code, a person learns how to work with different languages, HTML, CSS, and Database but does not teach the foundation of computers like software architecture or sorting or searching algorithms. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really would not worry about not getting a job that I was applied, unless this type is the future. And I do believe everything related to large amount of data and it’s processing and modelling is a future. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started doing the research on how to obtain that type of knowledge without spending a lot of money. The problem with self-education is that a person needs to have a roadmap and that is one of the advantages of the formal education. In formal education a person is guided on the sequence of learning materials that needed to be learnt compare to the self-education where it is a Wild West. I do not plan to spend a large amount of time every day to learn everything quickly, it’s a long-term project that I will spending on 1-2 hours a day. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         
                        After spending some time, I can across two great resources for self-education
                        <ol>
                            <li><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OpenCourseWare</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">Repository on a GitHub that guides through a free resource on Udemy and Crousera</a></li>
                        </ol>     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a deliberate consideration I decided to go with the MIT. I will be using the following 2 resources:
                        <ol>
                            <li><a href="http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/">MIT Bachalors in Computer Science Catalog</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OpenCourseWare</a></li>
                        </ol>
