                <div id="a-week2">
                    <p><abbr>JavaScript</abbr> is a modern programming language that could be used on the client side and server-side development. The most popular usage of <abbr>JS</abbr>  is on a front 
                    end along with HTML and CSS to manipulate DOM elements. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, <abbr>JS</abbr> supports all the basics as any modern programming language; such as, primitive data types, objects, flow controls, loops, arrays, etc. However, 
                        there are also some differences compare to other languages. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First of all, <abbr>JS</abbr> is not a compiled language, instead it uses an interpreter to run it is code. Another difference is hoisting. 
                        <dfn>Hoisting</dfn> has to do with how the engine that converts our code into meachine readable code executes <abbr>JS</abbr> code . First, the code is being scanned and all the variable and function declarations are moved to the top of the file. After that, the 
                        code is being executed. If a coder initializing the variable after it is usage, and exception will be thrown. However, if function is called before it 
                        being initialized, not exception is thrown. This gives us an ability to call a function even before it is being declared.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because it is nature of being an interpreted and not compiled language the variable types and the return type from the function could be omitted from 
                        the code and will be determined by the interpreter during an execution. The variables could be initialized using 3 keywords – <code>const, let, var</code>. <code>Var</code>keyword 
                        is not recommended to be used due to it is issue of not throwing an exception and rather be undefined if it is not initialized before it is used due to the 
                        hoisting. <code>Const</code> keywork if is used for initializing a value that cannot be changed. And for all other situations, it’s wised to use let keyword since 
                        the exception will be thrown if it is not initialized before it is used due to hoisting.  The use of <code>var</code> keyword is supported. However, it is advised not 
                        to be used since the debugging and error catching is harder compare to the use of let keyword
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another difference from another languages is the existence of unique property types; such as, <abbr>NaN</abbr> and <abbr>undefined</abbr>.<code>NaN</code> is a property that identify a variable 
                        as Not a Number and <code>undefined</code>is a property that identify a variable as declared but not initialized. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, <abbr>JS</abbr> support two different comparison operators -double equal sign and triple equal sign. The double equal sign only compares the value of the data, 
                        while the triple equal sign compares the type as well. For example, if we want to compare string 5 and integer 5, double equal sign will return true since 
                        JS do explicit data type conversion. On the other hand, triple equal sign will return false because even tough, the value is the same (5), one is string and 
                        another one is integer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other, that these differences, <abbr>JS</abbr> supports all the traditional functionality as OOPs concepts, flow controls, math operations, loops, arrays, etc. 
                    </p>

                        Hello everybody, my name is Oleksiy, and I am automation engineer with 6 years of experience in this field. Overall, 
                        I have been in Software Quality Assurance field for almost 10 years as of early 2021. I started my career as a manual tester and moved toward automation
                         about 5 years ago. I’ve been working with Java and C#/.Net technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As in any field, especially in technology a person is constantly has to learn and upgrade the existing skills. I like to spend a couple hours a day 
                        on learning new technology. My day usually start at 7 am and spend 2 hours on learning. My work starts at 9 am and that is when I completely 
                        focus on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That being said, I belevie one of the best ways to learn something new is to explain the topic to others. If a person is able to explain a subject in a plain
                        English, that means a person has a good knowledge of the topic. That's why I would like to start my blog to write about what I learn. This blog will be 
                        written in plain English without a single line of code. I believe when we try to explain a topic using a code, we dive into the technical implimentation. 
                        On the other hand, when we explain a topic using words only,when a person explains a concept, a person learns a concept rather than learning technical aspects 
                        of the implimentations of the concept.This blog is not intented to make money or being commercialized at any level. This is my own project that I am doing 
                        for myself. I would be happy if my posts will help others but that is not my main intent. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wish me luck and let us go 
                    </p>
